To day I went and visited Stone & Chalk in Circular Quay, Sydney.


>Stone & Chalk is an independent, not-for-profit Fintech hub whose overarching objective is to help foster and accelerate the development of world-leading Fintech start-ups

<cite>[Stone & Chalk][s-&-c]</cite>

I was there as part of a "soft launch" for a services that UTS:SDS is a part of. Stone & Chalk was a very interesting place to visit as I had not seen anything like it before. Stone and Chalk is what is know as a co-working environment, which is where multiple small start up work together in a small office space

This was a very valuable experience for me as one day I would like to  get into the startup space. The way the company was layout was very similiar to the innovative tech company stereotype. (e.g. share space, hipster decor). I though it was very funny how despite how "cheezy" this was, it really gave me a great idea of what I want to be. Experiences like this give me an opportunity to se what it is like working in a real world environment, I guess the next step is finding an internship. There was a mention of S&C offering internship positions at some of the small startups there so I am interested to learn more.

<!--Note: intership program sounded like the word fintech but that is something else-->
